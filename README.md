# My Conky config

## Setup
* Install Conky with either `sudo pacman -S conky` (Arch Linux) or `sudo apt-get install conky` (Debian/Ubuntu)
* Copy the files in this repository to `~/.conky` ("README.md" and "screenshot.png" can be safely skipped)
* Run `~/.conky/run_conky.sh`
* **Optional**: You'll probably want to add `~/.conky/run_conky.sh` to your startup applications. This process is different between desktop environments, it might be as simple as searching for "startup applications" in your menu and adding it to the list.
